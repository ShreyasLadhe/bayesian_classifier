# Thyroid Disease Bayesian Network Classifier

This project implements a Bayesian Network classifier to predict thyroid diseases using the UCI Thyroid Disease dataset.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the thyroid disease dataset.
- `src/`: Source code for the Bayesian Network classifier.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for initial data exploration (optional).
- `results/`: Stores model performance metrics (accuracy, etc.).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/thyroid-disease-bayesian-classifier.git
